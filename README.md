# LSTM
Code heavily borrowed from https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/lstm-python-stock-market. My goal is to oprganize everything better and make the hyperparameters more obvious. Then, hook up multidimensional data rather than just the time series. 

Same can be said for multidimensional version, at least around the first few commits, but with respect to this tutorial: https://machinelearningmastery.com/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-lstms-keras/
